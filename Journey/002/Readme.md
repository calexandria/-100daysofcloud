# Day 2

## Introduction

Since my main goal is to be working towards my AWS Solutions Architect, I'm continuing the path through the ACloudGuru path. 
Today I worked on two things:
- Creating and hosting a static webpage on S3
- IAM Introduction and lab

## Use Case

In this case, I used the lab to learn how to start one of the ACloudGuru challenges. The challenge is to build a portfolio website that is hosted on a cloud provider. There are some nuances and additional requirements that I'll work on going forward. I'll be sure to link my portfolio/resume site once it's finished! You can read more about the challenge [here](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/?opt_id=oeu1610990021029r0.8366634724772672)

IAM is important to ensure proper access and security. As someone who has a security focused day job, I found this section to be particularly interesting. I can certainly see why learning this will be helpful later on. Though this was only the beginning, I'm excited to learn more.

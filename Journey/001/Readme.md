# Day 1

## Introduction

I obtained my AWS Cloud Practitioner in February of 2020 and haven't spent dedicated time working on cloud since then. I used today to go back through the quizzes and information that I used to pass that exam as a refresher.

## Cloud Research

Today I went through chapters 1 & 2 and started chapter 3 of the AWS Solutions Architect path on ACloudGuru. The majority of this was theoretical and did not contain many labs. I used the sandbox feature to follow along and refamiliarize myself with the AWS platform and its offerings.
